															<h2>Giza Pyramids</h2>
															<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/All_Gizah_Pyramids.jpg"/>

															<h2>Description</h2>
															<div class="text">
																<p id="testtext">One of the seven ancient wonders of the world, the great pyramids of Gizaare marvelous feats of architecture. 
																The Giza complex consists of three large pyramids built for the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure.The grand structures were built between 2589 BC and 2504 BC. How they were built has been a source of debate. 
																The pyramids are part of the Giza Necropolis that also houses the Great Sphinx, smaller pyramids for queens and several complexes for the workers. Historians agree there was an immense amount of labor involved; 
																technical ingenuity and skill that went into the pyramids helped the structures remain standing today..</p>

															</div>

															<h2>Food</h2>
															<div class="text">
																<p id="testtext">A number of Western fast food options exist immediately opposite the main ticket gates to the Pyramid enclosure, Pizza Hut and KFC included, so you can munch on a Tower burger and sip on a coke in air-conditioned comfort whilst gazing on the 4,000+ year-old Sphinx across the road! Many may prefer a more 'authentic' experience at on of the following:
*Andrea, (on the road back to Cairo from Giza). This is a well-known restaurant specializing in pigeon and chicken grilled a la plancha that is popular with both locals and tourists. NB: that busloads of visitors are often found here after visiting the pyramids, so it is best to avoid in the late afternoon and evening. Well known to all the local taxi drivers.

*Fish Market, 26 Shar'a al-Nil (30-40 minutes drive from Giza off the Nile Corniche, in Ma'adi),  This eatery is located on the Nile, in a docked ship. Popular with locals and tourist visitors, but the food is mediocre, overpriced, and service is haphazard. Moderate to High.  edit

*Khan El Khalili, Mena House Oberoi hotel (Giza district, near the Pyramids). The restaurant has been open for over a century and is far and away the most stylish place for lunch or just a cold beer. Expect to pay Western prices for the privilege.

*Moghul Room, Mena House Oberoi (Giza district, near the Pyramids). An extremely good upmarket Indian restaurant. Reservations necessary.

*Nile Pharos (Dinner cruise), 138 El Nile Street (30-40 minutes drive from Giza in Zamalek). The boat features Pharonic decor, and offers a buffet with international and Egyptian cuisine, and belly dancing.

*Nile City, (30-40 minutes drive from Giza in Zamalek). Stationary boat on the Nile that includes several international franchises (Chilis, Johny Carinos, Fish Market & Studio Misr) coupled with an Egyptian grill and a seafood restaurant.</p>

															<h2>Abu Simbel</h2>

															<h2>Description</h2>
															<div class="text">
																<p id="testtext">Built on the west bank of the Nile River, between the first and second cataracts of the Nile, the site of Abu Simbel is one of the most recognizable ancient sites in Egypt. 
																It contains two temples, carved into a mountainside, that were built by pharaoh Ramesses II (1303-1213 B.C). The larger of the two temples contains four colossal statues of a seated Ramesses II at its entrance, 
																each about 69 feet (21 meters) tall. The entranceway to the temple was built in such a way that on two days of the year,  October 22 and February 22, 
																the light would shine into the inner sanctuary and light up three statues seated on a bench, including one of the pharaoh. It’s been hypothesized that these dates may celebrate his coronation and birth.</p>

															<h2>Food</h2>
															<div class="text">
																<p id="testtext">n Egypt, dining out can range from stand-up sandwich bars to luxurious five-course meals. You can find small, inexpensive establishments that serve good Egyptian food for only a few pounds.
																If you're in a hurry, try the local snack bars. While the cubbyholes off the street (which probably have running water) are generally safe.
																The larger cities even have Western-style fast-food chains like McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, but they're relatively expensive. 
																In cities both food and water are safe although the change in your diet may produce short-term gastrointestinal upsets.</p>

															<h2>Temple of Kanak</h2>

															<h2>Description</h2>
															<div class="text">
																<p id="testtext">Karnak is one of the premier sites in all of Egypt and one of the most visited. In fact, it is perhaps one of, if not the largest religious complex ever constructed anywhere in the world. 
																This vast, ancient Egypt complex demonstrates the religious significance of the area in ancient times. Though this complex is very complicated, by far the largest system of temples is that of Amun, a local god of Thebes (modern Luxor) who rose to national importance during Egypt's New Kingdom.

															<h2>Temple of Hatshepsut</h2>
															<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Hatshetsup-temple-1by7.jpg"/>

															<h2>Description</h2>
															<div class="text">
																<p id="testtext">The Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut, who ruled Egypt from around 1479 BC until her death in 1458 BC, is situated beneath the cliffs at Deir el Bahari on the west bank of the Nile. It is a colonnaded structure, which was designed and implemented by Senemut, the royal architect of Hatshepsut, 
																to serve for her posthumous worship and to honor the glory of Amun. The temple is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it and consists of three layered terraces reaching 30 meters (97 ft ) in height. These terraces are connected by long ramps which were once surrounded by gardens. 
																Hatshepsut is an intriguing character. She initially ruled as regent for her step-son Thuthmosis III but promoted herself to the role of pharaoh instead of passing power to him when he came of age. Her temple is one of the most striking monuments in Ancient Egypt even in its semi-ruined state.

																<p id="testtext">While there are some famous restaurants in the Forbidden City precinct (see listings below), dining options are limited in the Forbidden City itself. 
																There are some cafes and kiosks, but the range is limited and prices are high. As gas fires are not permitted within the historical buildings, ready meals and noodles are the main hot food options, along with sandwiches. It is probably better and cheaper to bring your own packed lunch. 
																A new restaurant with 500 covers is reportedly being planned for the Inner Palace area, in addition to the existing food court in the northwest near the Hall of Mental Cultivation.</p>

															<h2>Petra</h2>

															<h2>Description</h2>
															<div class="text">
																<p id="testtext">Taj Mahal is regarded as one of the eight wonders of the world, and some Western historians have noted that its architectural beauty has never been surpassed. 
																The Taj is the most beautiful monument built by the Mughals, the Muslim rulers of India. Taj Mahal is built entirely of white marble. Its stunning architectural beauty is beyond adequate description, particularly at dawn and sunset.
																The Taj seems to glow in the light of the full moon. On a foggy morning, the visitors experience the Taj as if suspended when viewed from across the Jamuna river.
																Taj Mahal was built by a Muslim, Emperor Shah Jahan (died 1666 C.E.) in the memory of his dear wife and queen Mumtaz Mahal at Agra, India. It is an "elegy in marble" or some say an expression of a "dream." 
																Taj Mahal (meaning Crown Palace) is a Mausoleum that houses the grave of queen Mumtaz Mahal at the lower chamber.</p>

																<p id="testtext">A trip to Lhasa takes the tourist to one of the 10 highest cities in the world. Because of its height, Lhasa’s climate remains relatively cool throughout the year, making the cultivation of crops difficult. 
																Lhasa’s gastronomy reflects its climate as well as typical Tibetan cuisine.A visitor to Lhasa will find that the traditional foods are rich in calories and often served very warm to combat the chilly atmosphere. 
																However, visitors can also find foods that remind them of home. Along with traditional Tibetan foods, there are restaurants that serve Nepalese, Chinese, Indian, Sichuan, and even western foods on occasion.</p>
